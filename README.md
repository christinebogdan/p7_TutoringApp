# Learn@Home | Define user needs for a tutoring app

## Developed Skills

- Create a mockup for a client
- Identify functional application requirements based on client needs
- Manage a code project using agile methodology
- Model a technical solution for a client using domain models

## Description

Learn@Home is an association that connects children who have difficulties at school with volunteer tutors. Their aim is to enable any student, wherever they are, to have access to remote tutoring.

Aim of the project was to **clearly define the client's needs**, before starting pure software development. A briefing with a summary of the client's expectations was provided.

## Objectives

### USE CASE DIAGRAMS

- develop use case diagrams for each of the major functionalites of each page (login, dashboard, chat, calendar, task manager)

### USER STORIES

- formulate user stories with acceptance criteria for each feature

### MOCKUPS

- create mockups of the site, with a basic design
- create at least one mockup per page

### KANBAN

- create a kanban dividing the project in a macro way (technical details excluded) into blocks of functionalities and sub-functionalities

## Client's expectations

To facilitate interaction and communication, Learn@Home wants to create a new website, which should consist of the following pages:

1. Login page
2. Dashboard page
3. Chat interface page
4. Calendar page
5. Task management page

### LOGIN PAGE

The login page must allow a student or volunteer to log in. All **other pages are only accessible once logged into an account**. This page must include :

- a system for **recovering forgotten passwords**
- a link to an **account creation** page

### DASHBOARD PAGE

This page will **serve as the main page** and should therefore include a **summary of all recent and important information** from the other pages: chat, calendar, task management.

The page will display :

- a to-do list from the task management page
- a to-do list from the calendar page
- a counter of unread messages

### CHAT INTERFACE PAGE

Learn@Home's chat interface should be a **classic chat page**, integrating a system for instant discussion between students and volunteers. It should provide:

- access to the **chat history**
- the ability to **add or delete a contact**.
- the **sender's profile picture** next to each message.
- an indicator to show whether **a message has been read or not**
- the **message timestamp**

### CALENDAR PAGE

The calendar page of Learn@Home should correspond to a **classic calendar page**, on which the user's various events and appointments are displayed.

### TASK MANAGEMENT PAGE

The interface of this page should allow you to **create tasks** for yourself or for another user.

- the **student** can only create **tasks for themselves**
- the **volunteer** can create tasks **for the students** he or she is following

## Requirements

- UML not necessarily required
- use Figma or Sketch for mockups
- use Trello, Notion or GitHub for Kanban board

## Challenges & Achievements

- create basic design and mockups with Figma
